TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock VgaHdmiCDxB.HdmixI/ClkVgaHdmi1024x600xG.ClkVgaHdmi1024x600xI/inst/ClkSys100MhzxCI is created on an inappropriate pin VgaHdmiCDxB.HdmixI/ClkVgaHdmi1024x600xG.ClkVgaHdmi1024x600xI/inst/ClkSys100MhzxCI. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock VgaHdmiCDxB.HdmixI/ClkVgaHdmi1024x600xG.ClkVgaHdmi1024x600xI/inst/ClkSys100MhzxCI is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
